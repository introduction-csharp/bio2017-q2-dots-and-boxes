# BIO 2017 Q2 Dots and Boxes

Ahead of this year's BIO, and in mind of recent object-oriented coding, please attempt Q2 - but in a 'proper' OO fashion.

In this repo I've primed you with an idea of what a test might look like for the given situation (and the first of the answers in the mark scheme). 

Do feel free to add this to your Tests project and then to add to it.
